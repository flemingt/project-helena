Atari XL keyboard replacement

What can go wrong with a bunch of switches? :)

Building on Ivop's project I've designed rev B, C, & D of the board.
Rev D has been designed with slightly different ribbon cable mounting points and moved the LED solder location to shorten the length of the board by a few mm. It is now ~111x346mm

The Helena Aux pcb plugs into the keyboard ribbon slot on the mainboard. For the 600XL 0.8mm seems to work, but 0.6mm or thinner is required for the 800XL.

I've added holes to make the switches PCB mount, some holes to mount stabilisers for the spacebar, and even more holes to align with the metal backplane of the original mylar / Stackpole keyboard of my 600XL. Maybe someone will need the mounting holes in the future. 

I've designed some 3D printed bracketry to use the screw posts in the top half of the case. Also some upper supports to minimise keyboard flex. These hook on to the PCB and the aluminium pieces that hold the cartridge doors.

I've designed cherry to Stackpole replacement stems for mechanical switches, but in the end I went for adaptors.

In addition, I've created a bracket to mount the U1MB expansion board. Note, you'll have to relocate the battery to make this all fit in the confines of a 600XL.

All the 3D printed parts use standard PLA, 50% infill. Some of the shapes area a bit tricky, but I've successfully printed everything with some thought on orientation and supports in the slicer.
